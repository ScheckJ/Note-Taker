## Description
The goal of this challenge was to modify starter code in order to connect the front end and back end of a note taking application. We were also required to create routes that would return json data as html 
## Installation
npm i express, fs, and uuid; git clone this repository
## Usage
This note taking app can be used in the same way as the notes app on most of our devices. You can type as many notes in as you like, save them, and delete them when you are ready.
